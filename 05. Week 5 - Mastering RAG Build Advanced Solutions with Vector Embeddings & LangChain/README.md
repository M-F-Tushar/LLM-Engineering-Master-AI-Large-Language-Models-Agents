## What is RAG?

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** is a technique that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing them with external, relevant information to improve their responses.

### The Simple Idea Behind RAG
Think of RAG like having a research assistant who:
1. **Listens** to your question
2. **Searches** through a library of documents to find relevant information
3. **Provides** that information to an expert (the LLM) along with your question
4. **Returns** a more informed, accurate answer

### Why RAG is Important
- **Overcomes knowledge limitations**: LLMs have training cutoff dates and may lack specific domain knowledge
- **Reduces hallucinations**: By providing factual context, models are less likely to make things up
- **Enables personalization**: You can create AI assistants that know about your specific data
- **Cost-effective**: No need to retrain massive models - just add your data to the context

## Core Components

### 1. Knowledge Base
- **What it is**: A collection of documents containing information relevant to your use case
- **Examples**: Company documents, product manuals, research papers, emails
- **Structure**: Organized in folders (e.g., employees, contracts, products, company info)

### 2. User Query Processing
- **Input**: User asks a question
- **Processing**: Question is converted into a format that can search the knowledge base
- **Example**: "Who is the CEO?" becomes a searchable query

### 3. Context Retrieval
- **Purpose**: Find the most relevant information from the knowledge base
- **Method**: Use similarity matching to identify relevant documents/chunks
- **Output**: Selected pieces of information that relate to the user's question

### 4. Enhanced Prompting
- **Process**: Combine the user's question with retrieved context
- **Format**: "Based on this information: [retrieved context], answer this question: [user query]"
- **Result**: LLM receives both the question and relevant background information

## Vector Embeddings

### What are Vector Embeddings?
**Vector embeddings** are numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning. Think of them as "coordinates" in a multi-dimensional space where similar concepts are located close together.

### Key Concepts

#### Autoregressive vs Autoencoding LLMs
- **Autoregressive LLMs** (like GPT-4, Claude): Generate text one token at a time, predicting the next word
- **Autoencoding LLMs** (like BERT): Process entire input at once and create a single output representation

#### How Embeddings Work
1. **Text Input**: "The king rules the country"
2. **Vector Output**: [0.23, -0.45, 0.78, ..., 0.12] (typically 1536 numbers for OpenAI embeddings)
3. **Meaning**: These numbers represent the semantic meaning in multi-dimensional space

#### Vector Mathematics
Famous example: `King - Man + Woman = Queen`
- This demonstrates that embeddings capture relationships between concepts
- Similar meanings cluster together in vector space

### Visualization
- **Challenge**: Vectors have hundreds/thousands of dimensions (hard to visualize)
- **Solution**: Use techniques like t-SNE to project down to 2D/3D
- **Result**: Can see how different types of documents cluster together

## Implementation Tools

### LangChain
**LangChain** is a framework that simplifies building LLM applications by providing pre-built components and abstractions.

#### Key Abstractions
1. **LLM**: Wrapper around language models (OpenAI, Claude, etc.)
2. **Memory**: Handles conversation history
3. **Retriever**: Interface for searching vector databases

#### Benefits
- **Quick development**: Build RAG systems in just a few lines of code
- **Model agnostic**: Switch between different LLMs easily
- **Standardization**: Common patterns for common tasks

### Document Processing
#### DirectoryLoader
- **Purpose**: Load multiple files from a folder
- **Usage**: Automatically reads all documents in a directory
- **Metadata**: Adds information about document source and type

#### Text Splitters
- **Why needed**: Documents are often too long for effective processing
- **Chunk size**: Target number of characters per chunk (e.g., 1000)
- **Chunk overlap**: Ensures continuity between chunks (e.g., 200 characters overlap)
- **Smart splitting**: Respects paragraph/sentence boundaries

### Vector Databases

#### Chroma
- **Type**: Persistent vector database
- **Storage**: Saves vectors to disk using SQLite
- **Use case**: Production applications requiring data persistence

#### FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
- **Type**: In-memory vector database
- **Performance**: Optimized for fast similarity search
- **Variants**: CPU and GPU versions available
- **Use case**: High-performance applications, temporary storage

## Building a RAG System

### Step 1: Prepare Your Data
```python
# Load documents
from langchain.document_loaders import DirectoryLoader, TextLoader
loader = DirectoryLoader("knowledge_base/", loader_cls=TextLoader)
documents = loader.load()

# Split into chunks
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200)
chunks = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
```

### Step 2: Create Vector Database
```python
# Create embeddings
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()

# Store in vector database
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
vector_store = Chroma.from_documents(
    documents=chunks,
    embedding=embeddings,
    persist_directory="vector_db"
)
```

### Step 3: Build RAG Pipeline
```python
# Create components
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain

llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.7, model_name="gpt-4")
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key="chat_history", return_messages=True)
retriever = vector_store.as_retriever()

# Create conversation chain
conversation_chain = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(
    llm=llm,
    retriever=retriever,
    memory=memory
)
```

### Step 4: Use the System
```python
# Ask questions
result = conversation_chain.invoke({"question": "Who is the CEO?"})
answer = result["answer"]
```

## Troubleshooting and Optimization

### Common Problems

#### 1. Wrong Context Retrieved
**Symptom**: Model says "I don't know" when information exists in knowledge base
**Cause**: Relevant chunks not being found by vector search

**Solutions**:
- Increase number of retrieved chunks (e.g., from 3 to 25)
- Adjust chunking strategy (smaller chunks, more overlap)
- Use entire documents instead of chunks
- Improve document organization

#### 2. Poor Chunk Quality
**Symptom**: Retrieved context doesn't contain complete information
**Solutions**:
- Experiment with chunk sizes (100-2000 characters)
- Adjust overlap (10-50% of chunk size)
- Ensure chunks respect document structure (paragraphs, sections)

#### 3. Hallucination Despite Context
**Symptom**: Model invents information not in provided context
**Solutions**:
- Use stronger system prompts: "If you don't know, say so. Don't make anything up."
- Provide more explicit context instructions
- Use models better at following instructions

### Debugging Techniques

#### Callback Handlers
```python
from langchain.callbacks import StdOutCallbackHandler

# Add to see what's happening
conversation_chain = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(
    llm=llm,
    retriever=retriever,
    memory=memory,
    callbacks=[StdOutCallbackHandler()]
)
```

This shows you:
- What prompt is actually sent to the LLM
- What context was retrieved
- How the model processes the information

### Optimization Strategies

#### 1. Retrieval Tuning
- **More chunks**: Generally better (models can ignore irrelevant context)
- **Similarity threshold**: Adjust how similar chunks need to be
- **Hybrid search**: Combine vector search with keyword search

#### 2. Chunking Strategy
- **Semantic chunking**: Split by meaning rather than just character count
- **Document-aware splitting**: Respect document structure
- **Overlapping content**: Ensure important information isn't split across chunks

#### 3. Prompt Engineering
```python
system_prompt = """
You are an expert assistant. Use the provided context to answer questions accurately.
If the answer isn't in the context, say "I don't have information about that."
Never make up information.
"""
```
