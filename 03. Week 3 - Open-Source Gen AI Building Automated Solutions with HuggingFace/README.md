## Pipelines: High-Level API

### What are Pipelines?
Pipelines are like pre-built tools that make AI tasks incredibly simple. Think of them as "one-click" solutions for common AI problems.

### Basic Pipeline Structure:
```python
# Step 1: Create a pipeline
pipeline = pipeline("task-name")

# Step 2: Use it
result = pipeline("your input")
```

### Common Pipeline Tasks:

#### 1. **Sentiment Analysis**
Determines if text is positive, negative, or neutral:
```python
classifier = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")
result = classifier("I love learning AI!")
# Result: POSITIVE (confidence: 99%)
```

#### 2. **Named Entity Recognition**
Identifies people, places, and things in text:
```python
ner = pipeline("ner")
result = ner("Barack Obama was the 44th president of the United States")
# Identifies: Barack Obama (PERSON), United States (LOCATION)
```

#### 3. **Question Answering**
Answers questions based on provided context:
```python
qa = pipeline("question-answering")
result = qa(
    question="Who was the 44th president?",
    context="Barack Obama was the 44th president of the United States"
)
```

#### 4. **Text Generation**
Creates new text based on a starting prompt:
```python
generator = pipeline("text-generation")
result = generator("The future of AI is")
```

#### 5. **Translation**
Converts text between languages:
```python
translator = pipeline("translation", model="Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-fr")
result = translator("Hello, how are you?")
# Result: "Bonjour, comment allez-vous?"
```

#### 6. **Image Generation**
Creates images from text descriptions:
```python
image_gen = pipeline("text-to-image")
image = image_gen("A futuristic classroom with AI robots")
```

#### 7. **Audio Generation**
Converts text to speech:
```python
tts = pipeline("text-to-speech")
audio = tts("Hello, welcome to AI!")
```

## Tokenizers: Understanding Text-to-Numbers Conversion

### What is Tokenization?
Tokenization is like breaking down sentences into puzzle pieces that computers can understand. Computers can't read words directly - they need numbers.

### How Tokenization Works:

#### **Basic Process:**
1. **Text Input**: "I love AI"
2. **Tokenization**: [128000, 40, 3021, 15592] (example numbers)
3. **AI Processing**: Model works with numbers
4. **Detokenization**: Convert back to readable text

#### **Key Concepts:**

##### **Tokens vs Words**
- **Tokens ≠ Words**: One word might be multiple tokens
- **Rule of thumb**: ~4 characters = 1 token (for English)
- **Example**: "Tokenizers" → ["Token", "izers"] (2 tokens)

##### **Special Tokens**
Special markers that give AI models important information:
- `<|begin_of_text|>`: Marks the start of input
- `<|end_of_text|>`: Marks the end of input
- `<|system|>`: Indicates system instructions
- `<|user|>`: Marks user messages
- `<|assistant|>`: Marks AI responses

### Working with Tokenizers:

#### **Creating a Tokenizer:**
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

# Load tokenizer for specific model
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B")
```

#### **Encoding (Text → Numbers):**
```python
text = "I'm excited to show tokenizers in action!"
tokens = tokenizer.encode(text)
print(tokens)  # [128000, 40, 2846, 12304, ...]
```

#### **Decoding (Numbers → Text):**
```python
decoded_text = tokenizer.decode(tokens)
print(decoded_text)  # "<|begin_of_text|>I'm excited to show tokenizers in action!"
```

#### **Batch Decoding (See Individual Tokens):**
```python
individual_tokens = tokenizer.batch_decode(tokens)
print(individual_tokens)
# ['<|begin_of_text|>', 'I', "'m", ' excited', ' to', ...]
```

### Chat Templates
Special formatting for conversation-style AI:

```python
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a joke"}
]

# Convert to model-specific format
formatted_prompt = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tokenize=False)
print(formatted_prompt)
```

**Result Example:**
```
<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>
You are a helpful assistant<|eot_id|>
<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
Tell me a joke<|eot_id|>
<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
```

### Model-Specific Differences
Different AI models use different tokenization approaches:
- **LLaMA**: Uses complex header system
- **Phi-3**: Uses simple tag system (`<|system|>`, `<|user|>`)
- **QWEN2**: Uses middle-ground approach
- **StarCoder2**: Optimized for programming code

## Models: Low-Level AI Processing

### What is the Model Class?
The Model class is like the actual "brain" of the AI - it's the neural network that processes information and generates responses.

### Creating and Using Models:

#### **Loading a Model:**
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

# Load model and tokenizer
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B",
    device_map="auto",  # Use GPU if available
    quantization_config=quant_config  # Memory optimization
)
```

#### **Key Parameters Explained:**
- **`device_map="auto"`**: Automatically uses GPU if available
- **`quantization_config`**: Reduces memory usage (explained below)
- **`trust_remote_code=True`**: Allows model-specific code to run

### Text Generation Process:

#### **Complete Workflow:**
```python
# 1. Prepare input
messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a data science joke"}]
inputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, return_tensors="pt")
inputs = inputs.to("cuda")  # Move to GPU

# 2. Generate response
outputs = model.generate(
    inputs,
    max_new_tokens=80,  # Maximum response length
    streamer=streamer   # For real-time output
)

# 3. Decode result
response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0])
print(response)
```

### Streaming Responses
See AI responses appear word-by-word (like ChatGPT):

```python
from transformers import TextStreamer

# Create streamer
streamer = TextStreamer(tokenizer)

# Generate with streaming
model.generate(inputs, max_new_tokens=80, streamer=streamer)
```

### Model Architecture Inspection
Look inside the AI "brain":

```python
print(model)  # Shows neural network layers
```

**What You'll See:**
- **Embedding layers**: Convert tokens to internal representation
- **Attention layers**: The "thinking" mechanism
- **Feed-forward layers**: Processing and decision making
- **Layer normalization**: Stability mechanisms

## Quantization: Memory Optimization

### What is Quantization?
Quantization is like compressing files - it reduces the memory needed to store AI models while keeping most of their intelligence intact.

### Why Quantize?
- **Memory savings**: Fit larger models in smaller GPUs
- **Speed improvements**: Faster processing
- **Cost reduction**: Use cheaper hardware

### Quantization Levels:

#### **Precision Levels:**
1. **32-bit (Full Precision)**: Original quality, maximum memory
2. **16-bit**: Half the memory, minimal quality loss  
3. **8-bit**: Quarter memory, slight quality loss
4. **4-bit**: Eighth memory, noticeable but acceptable quality loss

#### **Setting Up Quantization:**
```python
from transformers import BitsAndBytesConfig

# 4-bit quantization config
quant_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(
    load_in_4bit=True,              # Use 4-bit precision
    bnb_4bit_use_double_quant=True, # Double quantization for extra savings
    bnb_4bit_quant_type="nf4",      # Normalized 4-bit numbers
    bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.bfloat16  # Computation precision
)
```

#### **Memory Comparison Example:**
- **Original LLaMA 3.1-8B**: ~32GB memory needed
- **4-bit Quantized**: ~5.5GB memory needed
- **Quality loss**: Minimal for most tasks

### Double Quantization
Even more memory savings by quantizing twice:
- **First quantization**: 32-bit → 4-bit
- **Second quantization**: Compress quantization parameters themselves
- **Result**: Additional 10-15% memory savings
