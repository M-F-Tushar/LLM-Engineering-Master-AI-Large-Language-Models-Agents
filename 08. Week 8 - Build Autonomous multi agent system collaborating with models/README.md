# LLM Engineering Week 8: Multi-Agent Systems & Production AI

## Overview
Week 8 is the culmination of an 8-week LLM engineering course, focusing on building production-ready AI systems that can work autonomously without human input.

## Project: "The Price is Right" - Autonomous Deal Finding System

### What It Does
- **Monitors the internet** for deals posted on RSS feeds
- **Estimates product prices** using multiple AI models
- **Automatically sends notifications** when good deals are found
- **Runs continuously** in the background like a real service

## Day 1: Model Deployment with Modal

### Key Concepts Explained

#### What is Modal?
Modal is a **serverless cloud platform** that makes it easy to run code remotely without managing servers.

**Simple analogy**: Instead of buying your own computer to run a program, you "rent" computing power only when you need it.

**Benefits**:
- You only pay for the time your code actually runs
- No server setup or maintenance required
- Automatically scales up/down based on demand
- Provides $30 free credit for new users

**How it works**:
```python
# Instead of running locally (on your computer):
result = my_function()

# You can run remotely (in the cloud):
result = my_function.remote()
```

#### Infrastructure as Code
**What it means**: Describing your server requirements using code instead of clicking through websites.

**Example**: Instead of manually setting up a server, you write:
```python
# This code tells Modal: "I want a server with these specific programs installed"
image = modal.Image.debian_slim().pip_install("transformers", "torch")
```

#### Serverless Computing
**Simple explanation**: Like ordering food delivery vs cooking at home.
- **Traditional servers**: You own/rent a kitchen (server) that's always running
- **Serverless**: You only "order" computing power when you need it, pay per use

**Benefits**:
- Servers start automatically when needed
- Servers stop when not in use (saves money)
- No server management headaches

### Technical Implementation

The course deploys a **fine-tuned model** (created in Week 7) that actually performed better than GPT-4 and Claude on pricing tasks.

**Deployment process**:
1. Package the AI model with its dependencies
2. Deploy to Modal with GPU support (T4 graphics card)
3. Create API endpoints so other parts of the system can use it
4. Add caching to make repeated calls faster

## Day 2: Advanced RAG and Ensemble Models

### Key Concepts Explained

#### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
**What it is**: A technique that makes AI responses better by giving the AI relevant information before it answers.

**Simple analogy**: Like giving a student textbooks during an exam instead of making them memorize everything.

**How it works**:
1. **Store documents** in a special database (vector database)
2. **When asked a question**, find similar/relevant documents
3. **Give those documents** to the AI as context
4. **AI gives better answers** because it has relevant information

**Why it's powerful for pricing**: Instead of guessing prices, the AI can look at similar products with known prices.

#### Vector Embeddings
**What they are**: Numbers that represent text in a way computers can understand similarity.

**Simple analogy**: Like GPS coordinates for words - similar products have nearby "coordinates."

**Technical details**:
- Each product description becomes a list of 384 numbers
- Similar products cluster together in this number space
- Enables fast searching for similar items

#### Chroma Vector Database
**What it is**: A specialized database for storing and searching vector embeddings.

**In this project**:
- Stores 400,000 product descriptions as vectors
- Enables fast similarity search
- Supports semantic search (meaning-based, not just keyword matching)

#### Ensemble Models
**What they are**: Systems that combine predictions from multiple AI models to get better results than any single model.

**Simple analogy**: Like asking 3 different experts for their opinion, then combining their answers for a better final answer.

**How it works**:
1. Get predictions from multiple different models
2. Use math (linear regression) to find the best way to combine them
3. Final prediction = weighted average of all models

**Models combined in this project**:
- **Specialist Model**: The fine-tuned model from Week 7
- **Frontier Model**: GPT-4 with RAG context
- **Random Forest**: Traditional machine learning with modern embeddings

#### T-SNE Visualization
**What it is**: A technique for visualizing high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D.

**Purpose**: Helps verify that similar products actually cluster together in vector space.

## Day 3: Structured Outputs and Deal Processing

### Key Concepts Explained

#### Structured Outputs
**What they are**: A way to force AI models to respond in a specific, predictable format.

**Problem they solve**: Without structure, AI responses can be inconsistent:
- Sometimes: "The price is $50"
- Other times: "It costs fifty dollars"
- This inconsistency breaks automated systems

**How structured outputs work**:
1. Define exactly what format you want (using Python classes)
2. Tell the AI to respond in that exact format
3. Get back perfectly formatted data every time

**Example**:
```python
class Deal(BaseModel):
    description: str
    price: float
    url: str
```

#### Pydantic BaseModel
**What it is**: A Python tool for ensuring data has the right structure and types.

**Benefits**:
- Automatically converts between Python objects and JSON
- Catches errors if data is wrong type (e.g., text instead of number)
- Essential for reliable structured outputs

#### RSS Feeds
**What they are**: Automatic news feeds that websites publish when they have new content.

**Use in project**: Instead of manually checking deal websites, the system automatically monitors RSS feeds for new deals.

### Technical Implementation

#### Deal Processing Pipeline
1. **Fetch**: Collect deals from multiple RSS feeds automatically
2. **Parse**: Extract useful information from messy RSS data
3. **Clean**: Use GPT-4 to standardize and filter deals
4. **Structure**: Return data in consistent format for further processing

#### Production Code Quality
The course transitions from research/experimental code to production-ready code:
- **Add type hints** for better documentation
- **Include comprehensive comments**
- **Implement proper logging**
- **Structure code in classes** rather than notebook cells
- **Consider error handling**

## Day 4: Building Multi-Agent Systems

### The 5 Hallmarks of Agentic AI

#### 1. Task Decomposition
**What it means**: Breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces.

**Example**: Instead of "find good deals," break it into:
- Scan RSS feeds
- Extract deal information
- Estimate product prices
- Calculate discounts
- Send notifications

#### 2. Tool Use
**What it includes**: Function calling and structured outputs that give AI models specific capabilities.

**Examples**:
- Calling external APIs
- Reading databases
- Sending messages
- Processing files

#### 3. Agent Environment/Framework
**What it provides**: A shared infrastructure that all agents can use.

**Key features**:
- **Memory**: Shared information across agents
- **Communication**: Agents can call each other
- **Resources**: Shared databases, APIs, etc.

#### 4. Planning Agent
**What it does**: Coordinates what tasks to do in what order.

**Can be**:
- An AI model that plans dynamically
- Simple Python code for straightforward workflows
- Configuration files for basic task sequences

#### 5. Autonomy
**What it means**: The system has an existence beyond human chat interactions.

**Key characteristic**: Runs continuously in the background without human intervention.

### System Architecture

The course builds a 7-agent system:

1. **Planning Agent** - Coordinates all other agents
2. **Scanner Agent** - Finds deals from RSS feeds
3. **Ensemble Agent** - Combines multiple pricing models
4. **Specialist Agent** - Uses the fine-tuned model from Week 7
5. **Frontier Agent** - Uses GPT-4 with RAG
6. **Random Forest Agent** - Uses traditional ML
7. **Messaging Agent** - Sends push notifications

### Technical Implementation

#### Messaging Agent
**Purpose**: Sends notifications when good deals are found.

**Technologies used**:
- **Pushover**: Free service for push notifications (up to 10,000 messages)
- **Alternative**: Twilio for SMS (requires more setup)

**Features**:
- Custom sounds (like cash register sound)
- Works on phones and smartwatches
- Includes deal links for easy purchasing

#### Planning Agent
**Current implementation**: Simple Python code that knows the exact workflow.

**Workflow**:
1. Get deals from Scanner Agent
2. Turn each deal into an "opportunity" by getting price estimates
3. Sort by best discount
4. If discount > $50, send notification
5. Store in memory to avoid repeating

**Future enhancement**: Could be replaced with an AI model for dynamic planning.

#### Agent Framework
**What it really is**: A Python class that connects all the agents together.

**Key responsibilities**:
- **Database connectivity**: Manages the Chroma vector database
- **Memory management**: Stores and retrieves past opportunities
- **Logging**: Tracks what each agent is doing
- **Coordination**: Runs the planning agent and handles results

**Simple reality**: Despite the fancy name, it's just Python code connecting different AI models and functions.

## Day 5: User Interface and Autonomy

### Gradio Advanced Features

#### Gradio Blocks (Low-level API)
**What it is**: More advanced Gradio functionality for custom layouts.

**Difference from basic Gradio**:
- **Basic**: `gr.Interface()` - Quick setup for simple functions
- **Advanced**: `gr.Blocks()` - Custom layouts with rows, columns, and complex interactions

**Structure**:
```python
with gr.Blocks() as ui:
    with gr.Row():  # Creates a horizontal row
        with gr.Column():  # Creates columns within the row
            # Add UI components here
```

#### State Management
**What it does**: Allows the UI to remember information between interactions.

**Example**: `gr.State()` - Stores a list of opportunities that persists across UI updates.

#### Timer Component
**What it is**: An invisible UI component that triggers actions at regular intervals.

**Purpose**: Makes the system truly autonomous by running the agent framework every 60 seconds automatically.

### Final System Architecture

#### Complete Workflow
1. **UI loads**: Shows existing opportunities from memory
2. **Timer triggers**: Every 60 seconds, runs the agent framework
3. **Agent framework runs**:
   - Scanner finds new deals
   - Ensemble estimates prices
   - Planning agent identifies best opportunities
   - Messaging agent sends notifications
4. **UI updates**: Shows new opportunities
5. **User interaction**: Can manually trigger notifications for any deal

#### Production Features
- **Real-time logging**: Visual display of what each agent is doing
- **Memory persistence**: Stores past opportunities in JSON file
- **3D visualization**: Shows the vector database structure (mostly for show)
- **Continuous operation**: Runs indefinitely without human intervention
